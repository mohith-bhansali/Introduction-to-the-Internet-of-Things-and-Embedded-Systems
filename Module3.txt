Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information.

Clock frequency
Bitwidth of the datapath
Size of Flash memory
Number of pins
Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?
